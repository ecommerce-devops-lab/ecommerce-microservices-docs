# GitFlow Branching Strategy

## Overview

GitFlow is a branching model designed to manage the release lifecycle of a project through well-defined roles for each branch. In a DevOps context, where automation, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code (IaC) are key, GitFlow provides a structured way to separate stable environments (e.g., production) from development and testing phases.

## Branch Types

### 1. `main`

* **Purpose**: Holds the **production-ready** code.
* **CI/CD Role**: Automatically triggers **production deployments**.
* **Protection**: Must be protected with **pull request review**, **CI passing**, and **no direct pushes**.

### 2. `develop`

* **Purpose**: Integration branch for completed features, representing the next **release candidate**.
* **CI/CD Role**: Triggers **staging environment** deployments or testing pipelines.
* **Merges From**: Feature branches, after review and testing.

### 3. `feature/*`

* **Purpose**: Contains individual new features or enhancements.
* **Naming Convention**: `feature/short-description`, e.g., `feature/add-terraform-module`
* **Lifecycle**:

  * Created from: `develop`
  * Merged back to: `develop`
  * Deleted after merge

### 4. `release/*`

* **Purpose**: Prepares a release candidate for production.
* **Naming Convention**: `release/x.y.z`
* **Lifecycle**:

  * Created from: `develop`
  * Merged to: `main` (tagged with release version) and `develop`
  * Triggers final QA and production readiness checks

### 5. `hotfix/*`

* **Purpose**: Urgent patches to fix issues in production.
* **Naming Convention**: `hotfix/critical-fix-description`
* **Lifecycle**:

  * Created from: `main`
  * Merged to: `main` and `develop`
  * Tag with patch version (e.g., `v1.2.1`)

### 6. `bugfix/*` (optional)

* **Purpose**: Non-urgent bug fixes that are not critical for production.
* **Lifecycle**:

  * Created from: `develop`
  * Merged back to: `develop`

## Workflow Summary

1. Developers create `feature/*` branches off `develop`.
2. Once completed and tested, features are merged into `develop`.
3. When a release is stable, a `release/*` branch is created for staging and QA.
4. If QA passes, the release branch is merged into `main` and tagged.
5. If a critical bug is found in production, a `hotfix/*` branch is created from `main`, fixed, and merged into both `main` and `develop`.

## Git Commands Reference

```bash
# Start a new feature
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature

# Finish feature
git checkout develop
git merge feature/my-new-feature
git branch -d feature/my-new-feature

# Start a release
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/1.0.0

# Finish release
git checkout main
git merge release/1.0.0
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release 1.0.0"
git checkout develop
git merge release/1.0.0
git branch -d release/1.0.0

# Start a hotfix
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/fix-prod-issue

# Finish hotfix
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/fix-prod-issue
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Hotfix 1.0.1"
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/fix-prod-issue
git branch -d hotfix/fix-prod-issue
```

## Best Practices for DevOps

* **Automated Pipelines**: Integrate CI/CD workflows based on branch naming (e.g., deploy `release/*` to staging).
* **Secrets and Configuration**: Use environment-specific secrets and avoid hardcoding.
* **Infrastructure Code**: Manage Terraform, Ansible, or Kubernetes manifests in separate `feature/*` or `release/*` branches.
* **Pull Requests**: Always use pull requests with code reviews and automated tests.
* **Tagging**: Tag all production releases on `main` for traceability.

## Conclusion

GitFlow provides clear isolation between development, testing, and production. For DevOps projects where automation and reliability are essential, this model facilitates continuous delivery while maintaining quality and control over releases.
