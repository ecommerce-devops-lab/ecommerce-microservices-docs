# Microservices Project Documentation Repository

This repository contains the complete documentation associated with the design, architecture, and DevOps practices for the microservices-based project. It serves as a centralized and versioned source of truth for all architectural decisions, patterns, pipelines, and branching strategies used throughout the system.

## Contents

The repository is structured into several documentation files covering key areas of the project:

- **`branching-strategy.md`**  
  Describes the Environment-Based Branching Strategy used in the monorepo, replacing traditional GitFlow to better suit CI/CD and microservice deployments.

- **`gcp-implemented-patterns.md`**  
  Documents the architectural patterns implemented using Google Cloud Platform services.

- **`identified-design-patterns.md`**  
  Lists and describes the design patterns identified during the development and structuring of the base infrastructure.

- **`modular-architecture.md`**  
  Describes the modular architecture strategy adopted to separate concerns across microservices and promote scalability.

- **`pipelines-documentation.md`**  
  Provides a detailed overview of CI/CD pipeline workflows, automation flows, and environment deployment sequences.

- **`sprint_documentation.md`**  
  Contains notes and artifacts from recent sprint activities, including progress tracking and technical deliverables.

- **`diagrams/`**  
  Contains architectural and DevOps-related diagrams used throughout the documentation for visual reference (e.g., pipeline flowcharts, infrastructure layouts).

## Purpose

This repository ensures:

- A consistent and shared understanding of system architecture and practices
- Easier onboarding of new developers and DevOps engineers
- Centralized updates to infrastructure, branching, and deployment conventions
- Version control and history of architectural evolution
